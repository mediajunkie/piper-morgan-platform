# Piper Morgan Development Session Log

## Session 1 - Project Setup & Organization
**Date:** June 3, 2025  
**Duration:** Initial setup session  
**Participants:** Principal Architect guidance + PM

### Accomplishments
- ✅ Created Claude Project for Piper Morgan with comprehensive context
- ✅ Uploaded core project files: `project-overview.md`, `models.py`, `docker-compose.yml`, `main.py`, `chat-protocols.md`
- ✅ Established development workflow protocols in project context
- ✅ Identified missing domain models (Metric, Risk, UserSession, Knowledge)
- ✅ Planned integration of session logging with GitHub workflow

### Current Status
- Infrastructure: Deployed and tested
- API: Basic FastAPI with mock intent processing
- Repository: mediajunkie/piper-morgan-platform
- **Main Blocker:** Need to replace mock responses with real LLM intelligence

### Next Session Priorities
1. Create missing documentation (ADRs, API docs, deployment notes, LLM patterns)
2. Begin LLM integration - replace mock intent processing
3. Domain model enhancements (add Metric, Risk, etc.)

### Technical Decisions
- Session logging integrated with GitHub commits rather than separate Claude Project files
- Focus on tactical implementation over additional planning

### Notes
- Project context now comprehensive enough for effective Claude collaboration
- Ready for deep technical work with Opus for LLM integration
