# Piper Morgan Development Session Log

## Session 2 - Resuming development
**Date:** June 3, 2025  
**Duration:** Initial setup session  
**Participants:** Principal Architect guidance + PM

### What We Accomplished Today
✅ Implemented Real AI Intelligence - Replaced mock intent processing with Claude-powered classification
✅ Built Learning Scaffolding - Created event bus and feedback capture system following your architectural patterns
✅ Avoided Circular Imports - Properly structured code using your shared_types pattern
✅ Successful Integration - All systems working together: intent classification → learning signals → feedback capture

### Key Technical Decisions

* Chose "Option C: Minimal Learning Scaffolding" to balance immediate functionality with future learning capabilities
* Used your existing LLM client architecture with task-based routing
* Placed EventBus in shared/events/ and FeedbackCapture as a new service
* Maintained backward compatibility while adding learning features

### Current State
Piper Morgan can now:

* Understand PM requests using Claude AI (95% confidence on first test!)
* Identify knowledge gaps (found 4 relevant domains in test)
* Capture corrections for future learning
* Store all interactions in Redis

### Continuation Prompt for Next Session
"Ready to continue building Piper Morgan's capabilities. The learning scaffolding is working - intent classification and feedback capture are operational. Next priorities could include: testing with more complex PM scenarios, uploading PM knowledge (book), or connecting intents to actual workflows. What should we tackle?"


## Session 1 - Project Setup & Organization
**Date:** June 3, 2025  
**Duration:** Initial setup session  
**Participants:** Principal Architect guidance + PM

### Accomplishments
- ✅ Created Claude Project for Piper Morgan with comprehensive context
- ✅ Uploaded core project files: `project-overview.md`, `models.py`, `docker-compose.yml`, `main.py`, `chat-protocols.md`
- ✅ Established development workflow protocols in project context
- ✅ Identified missing domain models (Metric, Risk, UserSession, Knowledge)
- ✅ Planned integration of session logging with GitHub workflow

### Current Status
- Infrastructure: Deployed and tested
- API: Basic FastAPI with mock intent processing
- Repository: mediajunkie/piper-morgan-platform
- **Main Blocker:** Need to replace mock responses with real LLM intelligence

### Next Session Priorities
1. Create missing documentation (ADRs, API docs, deployment notes, LLM patterns)
2. Begin LLM integration - replace mock intent processing
3. Domain model enhancements (add Metric, Risk, etc.)

### Technical Decisions
- Session logging integrated with GitHub commits rather than separate Claude Project files
- Focus on tactical implementation over additional planning

### Notes
- Project context now comprehensive enough for effective Claude collaboration
- Ready for deep technical work with Opus for LLM integration
