# Piper Morgan 1.0 - Product Roadmap - June 6, 2025

## Overview
A three-horizon roadmap organizing development around thematic tracks. Timeline estimates are aggressive and assume single-developer execution with AI assistanceâ€”high risk of delays.

---

## ðŸŸ¢ NOW (Q2-Q3 2025)
*Goal: Basic working system - First complete user workflow*

### Intent & Execution Track
**ðŸŽ¯ Complete Workflow Execution** (*Critical - Currently Broken*)
- Database initialization and workflow persistence (3 points)
- Intent â†’ Workflow factory pattern implementation (5 points) 
- End-to-end GitHub issue creation from natural language (8 points)
- Basic error handling and user feedback (3 points)

**Reality Check**: Workflows currently don't persist. This is a blocking issue preventing any meaningful testing.

### Knowledge & Learning Track  
**ðŸŽ¯ Knowledge Base Improvements** (*Quality Currently Poor*)
- Document ingestion pipeline reliability (PDF, DOCX, TXT, MD) (3 points)
- Search relevance tuning and optimization (5 points)
- Context injection improvements for intent classification (3 points)
- Basic knowledge hierarchy validation (2 points)

**Reality Check**: Current search results are inconsistent. Need significant tuning before user testing.

### Integration & Orchestration Track
**ðŸŽ¯ Basic User Interface** (*API-Only Currently*)
- Simple web chat interface (5 points)
- Repository and settings management (3 points)
- File upload and knowledge base management (3 points)
- Workflow status tracking and monitoring (2 points)

**Reality Check**: No UI exists. Users must interact via API calls currently.

## ðŸŸ¡ NEXT (Q4 2025 - Q1 2026)  
*Goal: Enhanced reliability and multi-workflow capabilities*
*Assumes NOW phase successful and lessons learned*

### Intent & Execution Track
**ðŸš€ Advanced Workflow Types** (*High Complexity*)
- Multi-step workflow orchestration (13 points)
- Clarifying questions system (8 points)  
- Bulk operations and batch processing (8 points)

**Risk**: Complex orchestration increases failure modes significantly.

### Knowledge & Learning Track
**ðŸš€ Learning Mechanisms** (*Unproven Technology*)
- Dynamic knowledge hierarchy with relationships (8 points)
- User feedback learning loop implementation (8 points)
- Pattern recognition and continuous improvement (13 points)

**Risk**: Learning from user feedback is largely unsolved in practice.

### Integration & Orchestration Track
**ðŸš€ Extended Integrations** (*Multiple External Dependencies*)
- Jira, Linear, Asana connectivity (13 points each)
- Slack/Teams bot interfaces (8 points)
- Analytics dashboard connections (13 points)

**Risk**: Each integration is a potential failure point with separate maintenance overhead.

## ðŸ”µ LATER (2026)
*Goal: Strategic intelligence and organizational impact*
*Highly speculative - depends on solving multiple hard problems*

### Strategic Intelligence (*Research-Level Challenges*)
**ðŸŒŸ Organizational Intelligence**
- Cross-team knowledge synthesis (21 points)
- Predictive analytics and insights (21 points)  
- Strategic recommendation generation (21 points)

**Reality Check**: This requires advances in AI reasoning that may not be achievable.

### Advanced Capabilities (*Significant Technical Risk*)
**ðŸŒŸ Autonomous Workflow Management**
- Self-improving workflow design (34 points)
- Advanced decision support systems (21 points)
- Enterprise ecosystem integration (34 points)

**Reality Check**: Autonomous systems require solving AI safety and oversight challenges.

## ðŸ“Š Reality vs. Vision Comparison

| Track | Current Reality | 6-Month Target | Long-term Vision |
|-------|----------------|----------------|------------------|
| **Intent & Execution** | Basic classification, no persistence | Working GitHub integration | Complex autonomous workflows |
| **Knowledge & Learning** | Hit-or-miss search results | Tuned relevance, basic feedback | Self-improving organizational memory |
| **Integration & Orchestration** | API-only, single workflow type | UI + 2-3 integrations | Full ecosystem connectivity |

## ðŸ“Š Success Metrics by Phase

### NOW Metrics (*Establish Baselines*)
- **Completion Rate**: Percentage of intents that result in successful workflow execution
- **Quality Score**: User satisfaction with generated outputs (currently unmeasured)
- **Reliability**: System uptime and error rates (currently unknown)
- **Usage**: Daily active workflows (currently zero)

### NEXT Metrics (*Measure Improvement*)
- **Efficiency Gains**: Time saved vs. manual processes (need baseline first)
- **Learning Rate**: Measurable improvement in output quality over time
- **Integration Success**: Cross-system task completion rates
- **User Adoption**: Team members actively using the system

### LATER Metrics (*Organizational Impact*)
- **Strategic Value**: AI recommendations that influence actual decisions
- **Knowledge Leverage**: Cross-team knowledge reuse and discovery
- **Competitive Advantage**: Measurable improvement in product delivery speed
- **ROI**: Cost-benefit analysis of development investment

## ðŸš¨ Key Risks & Assumptions

### Technical Risks
- **Single Developer Dependency**: High bus factor risk
- **AI Model Reliability**: LLM consistency remains challenging
- **Integration Complexity**: Each external system adds maintenance overhead
- **Scale Challenges**: Performance with larger knowledge bases unproven

### Product Risks  
- **User Adoption**: Teams may resist AI assistance
- **Quality Expectations**: AI output quality may not meet professional standards
- **Workflow Fit**: PM processes may not map well to automated workflows
- **Change Management**: Organizational behavior change is difficult

### Timeline Risks
- **Optimistic Estimates**: Single developer with complex system integration
- **Unknown Unknowns**: AI development has unpredictable blockers
- **External Dependencies**: GitHub, Claude, OpenAI API changes could disrupt progress
- **Quality vs. Speed**: Pressure to deliver may compromise architectural quality

**Bottom Line**: This roadmap represents potential, not commitments. Success requires solving multiple hard technical and organizational problems simultaneously.
