- **Hybrid**: AI assistance + occasional specialist contractors for specific areas

**Recommendation**: Evaluate after completing P0 items to assess sustainable development velocity.

### Technology Stack Validation
**Decision Required**: Confirm current technology choices can deliver vision
- **Database**: PostgreSQL vs. more specialized solutions for workflow data
- **AI Integration**: Current multi-LLM approach vs. focusing on single provider
- **Deployment**: Local/Docker vs. cloud deployment for team use

**Recommendation**: Current stack appropriate for MVP, revisit after user validation.

### Feature Scope Management
**Decision Required**: Focus on depth vs. breadth of capabilities
- **Depth**: Perfect GitHub integration with advanced features
- **Breadth**: Basic integration with multiple systems (Jira, Slack, etc.)
- **Hybrid**: Core GitHub functionality plus selective additional integrations

**Recommendation**: Focus on GitHub depth first, proven value before expansion.

### Quality vs. Timeline Trade-offs
**Decision Required**: Acceptable quality thresholds for user testing
- **High Quality**: 95%+ accuracy, comprehensive error handling, polished UI
- **MVP Quality**: 80%+ accuracy, basic error handling, functional UI

## Conclusion

The Piper Morgan backlog represents a comprehensive vision for AI-assisted product management, but reveals significant implementation challenges that must be addressed realistically. Current backlog analysis shows:

**Critical Reality**: System is currently unusable for real work due to fundamental gaps in database persistence, workflow execution, and user interface. The P0 category represents blocking issues that prevent any meaningful value delivery.

**Development Challenge**: Estimated 16-20 story points of critical work to achieve basic functionality, representing 2-4 months of single-developer effort with high risk of delays due to integration complexity.

**Strategic Opportunity**: Advanced capabilities (P3 and Research categories) represent compelling long-term vision but require solving numerous complex technical challenges that may exceed current development capacity.

**Resource Mismatch**: Backlog scope and complexity suggest need for team development approach, but budget and organizational constraints favor single-developer execution.

**Bottom Line**: Backlog demonstrates ambitious but achievable vision for AI-assisted PM work. However, current implementation capacity is misaligned with scope complexity, requiring either timeline extension, scope reduction, or resource expansion to achieve stated goals. Priority focus must be completing P0 items before considering enhanced capabilities.
