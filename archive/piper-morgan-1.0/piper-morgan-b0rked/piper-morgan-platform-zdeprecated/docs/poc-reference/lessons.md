# Piper Morgan POC: Lessons Learned

## What Worked Well

- Custom exception hierarchy  
- GitHub integration approach
- Basic intent recognition

## Key Prompts to Preserve
- Issue creation prompt structure
- Intent recognition patterns
- JSON parsing approach

## Architecture Decisions to Keep
- Event-driven design
- Domain model importance
- Plugin architecture

## What Not to Do Again
- God object orchestrator
- Hardcoded mappings
- Tight coupling between services
