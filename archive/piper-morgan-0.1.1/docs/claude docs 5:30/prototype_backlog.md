Story: As a user, I want the agent to improve its suggestions based on my edits to generated tickets.

Develop a mechanism to capture user edits on agent-generated GitHub issues.

Explore feedback loops to fine-tune or adjust the agent's future responses.

Investigate techniques like Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) or simple feedback loops.
Estimate: 8 days (Exploratory Estimate) | Status: Research/Planning

AGENT-F002: Clarifying Questions for Input Ambiguity
Story: As a user, I want the agent to ask clarifying questions when my input is unclear.

Identify common ambiguities in natural language issue descriptions.

Implement a mechanism for the LLM to generate clarifying questions.

Develop a multi-turn conversation flow to incorporate user answers.
Estimate: 7 days (Exploratory Estimate) | Status: Not Started

AGENT-F003: Multi-Repository Context Support
Story: As a user with multiple projects, I want to easily switch between target GitHub repositories.

Implement robust handling for multiple GitHub repositories within the UI.

Manage repository-specific labels, templates, and team configurations.

Ensure context from the correct repository is used for issue drafting and review.
Estimate: 6 days (Exploratory Estimate) | Status: Not Started

üìà P2 - Medium Impact Feature Explorations
AGENT-F004: Advanced Document Ingestion
Story: As a user, I want the agent to better understand complex documents (e.g., nested sections, tables).

Explore advanced parsing techniques for structured documents.

Investigate methods for preserving document hierarchy and relationships in the knowledge base.

Improve chunking strategies for better retrieval.
Estimate: 5 days (Exploratory Estimate) | Status: Not Started

AGENT-F005: Proactive Information Suggestions
Story: As a user, I want the agent to proactively suggest relevant information based on my current task or context.

Develop triggers for proactive suggestions (e.g., when drafting a ticket, suggest related existing tickets or documentation).

Implement a notification mechanism within the UI.
Estimate: 6 days (Exploratory Estimate) | Status: Not Started

üí° Research - Long-Term Investigations
AGENT-R001: Evaluation Metrics & Benchmarking
Story: As a developer, I want to objectively measure the agent's performance and track improvements.

Define quantitative metrics for issue drafting quality, suggestion relevance, and knowledge retrieval accuracy.

Develop test sets and automated evaluation pipelines.

Establish benchmarks for comparing different LLM configurations or future models.
Estimate: Ongoing Research | Status: Not Started

AGENT-R002: Deeper Integration with Product Tools (e.g., Jira, Notion)
Story: As a PM, I want the agent to interact with a wider range of my daily tools.

Investigate APIs and data models of other common PM tools (Jira, Notion, Slack).

Prototype read-only or drafting integrations to explore potential value.
Estimate: Ongoing Research | Status: Not Started

üõ†Ô∏è Technical Considerations (Hypothetical for Future)
AGENT-T001: Migrate Vector Database (Hypothetical)
Story: As a system, we would need a more scalable vector database for broader adoption.

Research alternative vector databases (e.g., Pinecone, Weaviate, pgvector).

Design migration path and data export/import (if ever scaled beyond local).

Plan for minimal downtime during transition (if ever adopted widely).
Estimate: 5 days (Hypothetical) | Status: Planning (Long-term)

AGENT-T002: API Rate Limiting & Caching (Hypothetical)
Story: As a system, it would need to handle high usage without hitting API limits.

Implement intelligent rate limiting and queuing for LLM and GitHub APIs.

Add response caching for repeated queries.

Design graceful degradation strategies.

Monitor and alert on API usage patterns.
Estimate: 7 days (Hypothetical) | Status: Planning (Long-term)

AGENT-T003: Security Audit & Hardening (Hypothetical)
Story: As a security-conscious organization, we would want comprehensive security review for a shared tool.

Conduct security audit of all integrations and data handling.

Implement additional access controls and audit logging.

Review data handling and privacy practices for shared deployment.

Establish security monitoring and incident response.
Estimate: 8 days (Hypothetical) | Status: Planning (Long-term)

AGENT-T004: Performance Optimization (Hypothetical)
Story: As a user, I would want faster response times and better system performance if it were a shared tool.

Estimate: 6 days (Hypothetical) | Status: Planning (Long-term)

üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Sprint Planning Guidelines (Hypothetical for Future Iterations)
Sprint Capacity Recommendations
Sprint Duration: 2 weeks (Hypothetical standard)

Capacity: 8-10 story points per developer per sprint (Hypothetical standard)

Story Point Scale: 1 (1 day), 2 (2-3 days), 3 (3-5 days), 5 (6-10 days), 8 (11-15 days), 13 (16-20 days)
Note: These are standard agile guidelines that would be applied if Piper Morgan were to evolve into a shared project with dedicated development cycles.
