*Author: Christian Crumlish*

## 🟢 NOW (Current Sprint - Immediate Focus)
*Status: Available for team usage with core capabilities*

### Core Capabilities in Production
✅ **Natural Language Issue Creation**
- Convert casual descriptions to professional GitHub issues
- Automatic labeling and formatting
- Context-aware content generation

✅ **GitHub Integration**
- Secure API authentication and repository access
- Issue creation with metadata
- Error handling and validation

✅ **Knowledge Base Foundation**
- Document ingestion (PDF, DOCX, TXT, MD)
- Vector search and semantic matching
- Organizational context integration

✅ **Web Interface**
- User-friendly chat interface
- Settings management
- File upload capabilities

✅ **Issue Review System**

### Current Limitations & Technical Debt
⚠️ **Fixed Knowledge Hierarchy** - Simple 4-tier structure needs evolution to dynamic relationships
⚠️ **Single Repository Focus** - Limited multi-project workflow support
⚠️ **Basic Learning** - No feedback loop from user edits yet
⚠️ **Local-Only Deployment** - Individual setup required, no shared instance

### Immediate Stabilization Tasks
🔧 **User Onboarding** - Create setup documentation and training materials
🔧 **Error Monitoring** - Implement logging and error tracking
🔧 **Performance Baseline** - Establish metrics for response times and success rates
🔧 **Security Hardening** - Review and strengthen access controls
