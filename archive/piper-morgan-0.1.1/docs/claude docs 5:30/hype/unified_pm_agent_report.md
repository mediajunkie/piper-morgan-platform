## 2. Introduction: The Original Vision

The project began with the following research objectives:

> "I am researching how best I can develop and train my own AI agent as a sort of 'junior associate product management intern' to gradually give some of my more routine knowledge-management tasks to. You can perhaps help me understand the best platforms and services available for me now to experiment and learn and explore this ideas without fully committing to any one platform prematurely."

**Target capabilities identified:**
- Writing GitHub tickets with proper formatting and context
- Generating reports and documentation
- Checking analytics sources and reporting on anomalies
- Digesting large bodies of legacy context for complex software projects
- Providing on-demand information derived from historical documentation
- Learning from patterns and improving over time

**Secondary research question:**
- Ability to analyze meeting transcripts and generate appropriate visualizations (mind maps, Wardley maps, domain models, Eisenhower matrices)
