# Requirements Document: PM Agent v0.1

**Project Name:** PM Agent
**Version:** 0.1 (Proof of Concept)
**Date:** May 31, 2025

---

**1. Introduction**
This document outlines the functional and non-functional requirements for the initial Proof-of-Concept (POC) release of the PM Agent. The agent aims to assist product managers and developers by automating routine GitHub interactions through natural language processing.

**2. Functional Requirements**

**2.1. User Interaction (Chat Interface)**
* **FR-UI-001:** The system SHALL provide a web-based chat interface (Streamlit).
* **FR-UI-002:** The user SHALL be able to type natural language queries into the chat interface.
* **FR-UI-003:** The system SHALL display the conversation history between the user and the agent.
* **FR-UI-004:** The system SHALL allow configuration of the target GitHub repository (owner/repo format).
* **FR-UI-005:** The system SHALL allow specification of `client_name` and `project_name` to aid context retrieval.

**2.2. Intent Recognition**
* **FR-INT-001:** The system SHALL identify the user's intent from natural language input using an LLM.
* **FR-INT-002:** The system SHALL support the `create_issue` intent.
* **FR-INT-003:** The system SHALL support the `get_issue_status` intent.
* **FR-INT-004:** The system SHALL recognize `unknown` intents for queries outside its defined capabilities and provide a graceful response.

**2.3. GitHub Integration**
* **FR-GH-001:** The system SHALL connect securely to GitHub using a personal access token.
* **FR-GH-002:** For `create_issue` intent, the system SHALL automatically generate a GitHub issue with:
    * A descriptive title.
    * A detailed body based on the user's request and retrieved context.
    * Relevant labels.
* **FR-GH-003:** For `get_issue_status` intent, the system SHALL retrieve the status (e.g., "Open", "Closed") and title of a specified GitHub issue.
* **FR-GH-004:** The system SHALL provide a direct link to the created/retrieved GitHub issue.
* **FR-GH-005:** The system SHALL handle cases where a specified GitHub repository or issue does not exist.

**2.4. Knowledge Base Integration**
* **FR-KB-001:** The system SHALL use a local vector database (ChromaDB) to store and retrieve contextual documents.
* **FR-KB-002:** The system SHALL retrieve relevant documents from the knowledge base based on the user's query and specified `project_name`.
* **FR-KB-003:** Retrieved context SHALL be provided to the LLM to enhance issue generation and response accuracy.

**2.5. LLM Interaction**
* **FR-LLM-001:** The system SHALL interface with an LLM (currently Anthropic Claude) via a standardized adapter.
* **FR-LLM-002:** The system SHALL leverage the LLM for:
    * Intent classification.
    * Extraction of key parameters (repo name, issue number, request description, project/client names).
    * Generation of structured JSON output (e.g., `IssueTemplate`).
    * Free-form text responses for unknown intents.
* **FR-LLM-003:** The system SHALL attempt to parse structured JSON responses from the LLM robustly, handling minor formatting variations.

**3. Non-Functional Requirements**

**3.1. Performance**
* **NFR-PERF-001:** The system SHALL aim to respond to simple queries (e.g., status check) within 5 seconds.
* **NFR-PERF-002:** The system SHALL aim to respond to complex queries (e.g., issue creation with context) within 15-20 seconds.

**3.2. Reliability**
* **NFR-REL-001:** The system SHALL implement custom exceptions for distinct error conditions (GitHub API, LLM, Knowledge Base, Parsing).
* **NFR-REL-002:** The system SHALL log all critical operations and errors to a file (`app.log`) and console.
* **NFR-REL-003:** The system SHALL provide user-friendly error messages in the chat interface when errors occur.

**3.3. Scalability**
* **NFR-SCA-001:** The architecture SHALL be modular to allow for future expansion of intents and integrations.
* **NFR-SCA-002:** The `LLMAdapter` pattern SHALL support integration of other LLM providers without major architectural changes.

**3.4. Maintainability**
* **NFR-MNT-001:** The codebase SHALL adhere to Python best practices (e.g., type hints, docstrings, clear module separation).
* **NFR-MNT-002:** Configuration parameters SHALL be externalized (e.g., `.env` file) for easy modification.

**3.5. Security**
* **NFR-SEC-001:** GitHub and LLM API keys SHALL be stored securely (e.g., environment variables, not hardcoded).
* **NFR-SEC-002:** The system SHALL avoid exposing sensitive API keys or internal errors directly to the user interface.

**3.6. Usability**
* **NFR-USE-001:** The chat interface SHALL be intuitive for product managers and developers.
* **NFR-USE-002:** The system SHALL provide clear and concise responses to user queries.
